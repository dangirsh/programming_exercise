* Fixed points

f(x) = x
=> f(f(x)) = x


* DAGs

G(V, E)

E subset VxV

E directed

No cycles

** Topological Sort

* Problem

Write function f(G, T) => (G', T')

- G: Graph
- T: List of vertices (topological sort)

- After each execution of f:
- |V_G| >= |V_G'|
- |T| <= |T'|

- Initial Value: f(G, [])
- Fixed point of f, with that initial value = (Empty graph, topological sort of G)
