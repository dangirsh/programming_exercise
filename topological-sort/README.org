* Fixed points

f(x) = x
=> f(f(x)) = x


* DAGs

G(V, E)

E subset VxV

E directed

No cycles

** Topological Sort

* Problem

Write function f:

G: Graph
T: List of vertices (topological sort)

f(G, T) => (G', T')

|V_G| >= |V_G'|
|T| <= |T'|


Initial Value: f(G, [])
Fixed point of f, with that initial value = (Empty graph, topological sort of G)
